### Hi, Ben here ðŸ‘‹

<p align='right'><img src="https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=bgelens.visitor-badge"></p>

I'm a Consultant / Engineer / Developer at [Wortell](https://github.com/wortell) and I love to code!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a massive configuration / infrastructure as code project for a global player in the realms of Azure and AWS. Because this is not enough to keep me occupied, I'm also working on a micro-services application for Wortell.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning so many new things and expanding my knowlegde into new directions. Programming in C#, creating helm charts, developing GitHub actions and workflows, simply too much to sum up ðŸ˜„
